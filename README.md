# Background
## GLORI
We developed an absolute m6A quantification method (“GLORI”) that is conceptually similar bisulfite sequencing-based quantification of DNA 5-methylcytosine.
GLORI relies on glyoxal and nitrite-mediated deamination of unmethylated adenosines while keeping m6A intact, thereby achieving specific and efficient m6A detection.

## GLORI-tools

GLORI-tools is a bioinformatics pipeline tailored for the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data generated by GLORI。
GLORI-tools currently works, but is still being optimized for a better user experience.
